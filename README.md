# bootstrap
scripts to bootstrap fresh windows install

# Instructions
1. Run powershell (`wt`) as admin and paste the following:
    ```ps1 
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    iex "& { $(iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Balfa/bootstrap/main/bootstrap.ps1) } -ComputerName Weggles -PackageLevel 'personal'"
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
    ```

# TODO
- Make it even more unattended. Single paste raw github file?
- Start migrating apps from choco to winget?
- Maybe split personal into gaming, dev, etc.?
- The rest of postinstallfirststeps...
- Test each change/install
- Validate idempotency
- Test uninstalling packages
- Move the references of gist.githubusercontent.com to files in this repo (or _possibly_ other repos).
  - Maybe move the references of raw.githubusercontent.com in here also from their respective repos?
- Do the packages in boxstarter-administered-appliances.txt get installed for all uers?
  - Test this. I don't think they do. That might be a problem ðŸ˜‘
